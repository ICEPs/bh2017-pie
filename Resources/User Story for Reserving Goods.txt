USER STORY for RESERVING GOODS
	- DONATEE reserves
	- DONATEE is asked to (optionally) edit the SMS to be sent to DONATOR
	- Transaction object is created, and is marked pending
	- DONATOR receives SMS asking to confirm
	- DONATOR either confirms or denies
		- if denied, Transaction is deleted, Item is returned to HostList
		- if confirmed, remove "pending" tag
		--> either way, the app still sends a message
